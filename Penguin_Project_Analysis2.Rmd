#MAKING FUNCTIONS#-----------

#Make function called cleaning_penguin_columns created from one input called raw penguins which we'll then do things to create new funct. Remove_empty means if any blank row/col it gets removed. C means it wants to remove rows and columns.The function is that when we use it later it code, this is the steps I want the computer to do (remove empty rows/cols). It doens't matter that we use different names (raw data vs penguins_raw)

  clean_names()%>%

#below code tests function:
#load raw data again

#Save clean data - can use here() to save it in csv

#can move cleaning to function to a separate script. Keep safe copy of code, can load them into different scripts-----------------------------------------------------
